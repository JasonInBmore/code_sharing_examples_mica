# Coding sharing examples for MICA talk

This repo contains a couple R files related to the talk "A Case for Coding" given on July 12, 2023.

`reproducible _script_example.R` - This is an example of how code can be shared with others and how it can be easily run on their computers. In this case, the datasets come from the internet, so everyone uses the same data source. If you have the three libraries installed, the script will create a basic map and save it. The saved map image will look the same on our computers.

`using_sql_with_R.Rmd` - This Rmarkdown file gives tips and examples to interact with SQL data from R. The code won't execute but the file will still knit. This might be helpful when using these data tools together.
